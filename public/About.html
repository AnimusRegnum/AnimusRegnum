          We are creating a game where people can fully experience the concepts of justice, responsibility, and the freedoms of sovereignty. We wanted to make sure that players could make their own choices and that the game is built in a way where people can choose to play it in any way they like. In the game, every action is meaningful.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Every decision leads to unique consequences. Yes, there are many ways to achieve goals, but your experience will depend on how you handle each conflict along the way, and can influence the history of the Animus Regnum Cosmos.
        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Every asset in the game will be an NFT token and will be created with the power of the blockchain. NFT is an acronym for Non-Fungible Token. The concept of an NFT is that each token will be unique, yet be completely interchangeable with other assets.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          These assets will differ in their properties, which makes them all unique. They will have different prices in the marketplace, but it will be possible to exchange one for another in a completely decentralized manner.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This is exactly what we are aiming for with our game, so it will be possible to trade all the assets found in the game's universe. We are making it so you can own the galaxy you play in, your planets, the moons and space stations that orbit that planet, the sun in that system, asteroids with rare resources in that system, the gas, the liquids, the solids, agriculture, finance, food, and everything else.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- right -->

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          When you go to shops to buy armor, weapons, cars, fashion, art, d√©cor, real estate, those are all NFTs. When you find planets, systems or even mine various resources, which can be gases, liquids or solids, those are all NFTs that will show up in your wallet.
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        We will also be creating a custom wallet for this game as we gain resources for this project, that connects to our site and also will be an app you can download to check your inventory for the game.
      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Assets in game are in the open world and can be vulnerable to these things. There will be a disclaimer that explains the risk of leaving assets in game, because all crimes in game will have to be resolved in game.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Meaning if someone steals all of your assets, you'll need to get justice yourself or by using the systems set in place to get justice for you. As well, the destruction and maintenance of assets in the open world.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          If an asset can expire, like food and resources like that, you will need to keep an eye on these things. Regarding assets like weapons and armor, these will have durability levels that need to be maintained. These things apply to many assets like cars, starships, and anything that would require maintenance naturally.

          When you own a planet, star system or galaxy in the Animus Regnum cosmos, you are the sovereign owner of that asset and can sell land on the planets if you wish. You can also set the governance and tax rates for the planet and it's resources.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        Resources include all commodities in the game such as gases, liquids, & solids that can be extracted from the planets, asteroids, and anywhere in that space where these resources can be harvested. This also includes agriculture, finance, food, and other resources in this realm. You will be able to control the tax rate for all of these resources and can make it so there is no tax if you wish.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This applies to star systems and galaxies as well. The only difference being that you can't sell land but rather space and asteroid belts for space stations and space mining operations, and so on. Ownership of a star gives you the ability to control  access to solar energy in that system and can act as the head of solar energy companies in that system if you wish.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This doesn't include assets like weapons, starships, armor, pets, and more personal assets that are each unique pieces and aren't commodities. Rather, taxes can be set on the sale of these assets and can be adjusted depending on the assets being sold.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          An example is if you wanted to set higher taxes for weapons and lower taxes for agriculture, you have those options. Owners of galaxies will receive their system with a super-massive black hole that is used for traveling massive distances in space from one galaxy to another.

        </p>

        <p>
          As a sovereign of the planets and systems you own, you have the means to create entire societies based on the laws you have set in place for the players and NPCs that live in your space. You can choose to be a good or evil leader based on your actions, giving birth to centralized dictatorships or a decentralized utopia.
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        The choice is yours, as we aim to make the control you have over governance diverse enough to create complex player-based storylines that are structured around your decisions.

        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Being based off our own blockchain as well will allow all the actions taken in the game to be written on chain and make it possible for sovereign holders of their planets and systems to create their own DAOs.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This makes it possible for the decisions you make to become something that is set in stone upon confirming these amendments to your governance structures. You will be able to create your own judicial systems and decide how crimes are punished as well. As we've stated, the goal is to make sure that you can experience as much freedom to create complex societies as possible.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          It will be your responsibility to protect your planets, citizens and assets in game should you wish to prevent their destruction and/or theft. There are universal laws set in place by the Elder Magi and their government is known as Magistri.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Magistri is the head of all governments, but they don't get involved with most crimes that aren't seen as serious. They are focused on keeping order in the universe and ensuring free will is not tarnished. The Magistri have different sectors and levels of military and police to help deal with smaller crimes and issues.

          This includes making sure all of the planets and systems in the universe can keep their cultures and traditions alive while also interacting with each other on a universal level.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        For example, if your galaxy becomes allies with another one, they can travel and interact with each other and their citizens and assets in the same way they do with anyone from another planet.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The Magistri have a senate known as the High Council that is made up of citizens from each planet and system in the universe. To become a part of this, you need to have a certain amount of power and influence in your system.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This makes it so that you have a say in the way the universe is run and the decisions that are made. Systems and societies that are marked as evil or tyrannical will not be allowed to take part in the High Council.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The police force known as Vigil 6 are the base of the Magistri's judicial system and look for criminals that threaten the safety of the universe and their job is to seek out and arrest or kill anyone that breaks minor laws such as homicide and theft cases. Stolen items are marked on the blockchain when they are taken by a player and marked when they are sold.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          If you don't have the right to own the items, Vigil 6 will come and arrest or kill you, take your assets, and leave behind a mark on your record as a criminal. They usually ignore small value thefts, but if a crime like this exceeds a certain value or is called in by a citizen, they will get involved.

        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- right -->

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Vigil 6 oversees small crimes and civil issues, while Libra is a more advanced force and military, directly commanded by the Elder Magi. Libra also acts as the judicial branch for the Elder Magi and oversees the trials and cases for all the criminals in their custody.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        Libra mainly deals with corrupt governments and societies that threaten the balance of order in their system. They are the ones focused on the more severe crimes that can disrupt the balance of systems and planets. The special ops are known as MAGI, the most elite warriors the Elder Magi have at their hand.

        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The MAGI are the last resort and are reserved for the most serious missions. Unlike the Elder's, who play a more significant role in the cosmos, maintaining it and keeping it free of rogue AI, and the Dark Gods, the MAGI are a failsafe, used for protecting planets and entire systems from total annihilation.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          If a planet or system becomes rampant with rogue AI and chaos from the Dark Gods, the MAGI are deployed to those locations to provide assistance to systems and planets threatened by these things. This doesn't mean it's impossible for a planet to become a wasteland or even be destroyed. It just makes it harder to happen and keeps the games balances in check.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Criminal activity will be met with swift action by Vigil 6, Libra, and MAGI, but any minor crimes that aren't too serious will be dealt with by the players and their governments. Should players want to involve them in issues they'd usually ignore, they will need to be compensated for their services. If someone breaks into your house, harms your family, or kills someone, you'll have full rights to seek revenge against the person who harmed you.

          You can also simply hire someone to defend you, your family, your home or your planet. These are all your choices. We are building a game that is structured for personal freedoms that will be decided by the players themselves. We firmly believe that this will be a great addition to the game and creates a diverse environment that allows for a ton of possibilities.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        Much like life, a file can grow. The longer you stay a criminal, the more crimes you commit, and the bigger the file keeps getting. Eventually it becomes so big that going straight becomes a Herculean task.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          You will need to make big changes in your life because your past will always drag behind you like a cement block tied to your foot.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          However, if you're looking for a serious challenge and an experience that really test your skills and ability to overcome all odds, this might be the play style for you, just know it comes with consequences, but can be very rewarding if you can get away with your crimes successfully.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Each player will have a bounty based on the severity of crimes committed and will need to pay their bounty off with in-game currency. If they can't pay off their bounty, they will be arrested and jailed until they can pay off their debt. If they can't, they'll be put into slavery or put to death. It's up to the player to decide how they want to approach things. They can also become bounty hunters and arrest criminals for profit.

          Animus Regnum will have an extensive player-based combat system that incorporates several different styles of combat. Each race and galaxy will have a system of martial arts associated with them. So close quarter combat (CQB) is as intense and realistic as possible. We will be hiring martial artists from all over the world to create custom mo-caps (motion captures) that will be used to program our AI and see if we can even create unique fighting styles through AI.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        With melee combat being a factor in battle, using weapons such as swords, daggers, staffs, nunchaku, and other physical based weapons, you can also use guns and explosives in the game for more guerrilla warfare experiences that combine both melee and ranged combat.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          On top of that we are in a sci-fi fantasy so there will be using abilities like magick and psychic powers. The universe is vast, so there will be beings where all they use is their powers for means of defense and offence, because this is their culture and their natural ability to do so.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          PvP (player vs. player) in game will be one of the main points of experience in the game. Aside from exploration and quests, there will be a colosseum where avatars from all over the Animus Regnum Cosmos can come to experience combat that is not lethal or combat to the death. Combat to the death will be the most rewarding, but death in the game can be costly. You won't lose your character or anything, but all characters will have a respawn timer that increases every time you die in succession. The timer resets if you stay alive for a certain time as well.

          There are five grades of rarity in the game. They are common, rare, exotic, legendary, and godly. These will apply to most assets in the game and are one way to tell an item's value. There are many factors in the game that make items valuable and you will need to use common things at times for the means of accessing or creating something of higher rarity. All things will have their own unique place alchemically in the game so the balance of the economy remains stable.


        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        We also will have skill trees for many different things in the game, making them as diverse as possible. This will give birth to the ability for players to experience unique character builds that can't be replicated unless someone follows your build pattern directly.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Even then, they won't be the same because of the unique qualities of each asset being it's own NFT with it's own random stats. Each asset in this game is unique and no two assets will be the same, allowing the player experience to become more personal. Even some weapons and vehicles will have skill trees. The same goes for companions such as pets, steeds, familiars, and AI.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          On top of that, we will have one of the most diverse race selections in gaming. We aim to create as many different races of beings that are known and unknown as possible. You could be an Orc, an Elf, a Human, or an Arcturian, a Reptilian, or some other alien race that will invent ourselves. There will also be sub-races, like vampires, lycanthrope (werewolves'), undead, etc.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          We want to make  character build and customization as diverse as possible. There will also be the ability to bread with other beings creating potential hybrids if your species can procreate.

      </div>

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Classes in the game will exist, in the sense of warriors, rangers, mages, assassins', bards, paladins, knights, monks, chefs, and the list goes on. There will be a long list of classes that evolve into greater classes over time and become something truly one of a kind depending on your choices. Like sub-races, guess what?
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        Subclasses are available too. Allowing you to take the skills from two different classes to create a fighting style that fits your play style. What you choose to do depends on your goals and is something that you need to make sure you think about, as your build decisions and actions can be permanent.
        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The game will have very diverse factions. The factions will be broken up into groups, starting with the first profile of factions, which are the races. The next group of factions will be based on the galaxy you are in. There will also be other groups that are still being thought of, but these are the first two that are confirmed. The factions themselves are what make up the economy, politics, and social life of the game. Alliances will come and go. Wars will take place, etc.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Quests in the game will be a main source of experience, leveling up, and acquiring new assets such as armor, weapons, money and other resources that will help you on your journey. Players will have the means to begin quests or they can be accepted from a mission board created by a government, guild, society, NPCs, and even other players. One of the main quests will be a tutorial quest that a player will have to complete, teaching them the basics of the game, but also the basics of surviving in the universe.
