          The Elder Magi are mysterious, gods themselves, who believe in the balance of good and evil as being above the gods themselves.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        They believe the balance between these two opposites, to be the source of all life and creation itself, but with one major flaw: light cannot exist without Dark and Dark cannot exist without Light.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Without one who can topple their other from their pedestal, the balance is lost. However, these beings must be balanced with wisdom.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The Elder Magi are not entirely gods within themselves, but are beyond gods in the reality of their own world. They have obtained powers beyond the gods themselves. Thus, they became beings who dwarf the gods in their own realms.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          They are also the true creators of worlds beyond the sky. They created a multitude of worlds, including Yggdrasil, the Earth, and its world, along with all the gods. As such, the Elder Magi are beings of great power, refined wisdom, and a nod to an order greater than the gods themselves.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The wisest and most powerful mages are known as the Elder Magi. They were the ones who created familiars, imbuing them with an essence extracted from the Old Gods. There are gods that have no divine power of their own and must imbue their own strength upon gods with the rare essence known as ichor.

        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- right -->

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Nevertheless, the Elder Magi may imbue the power of a god to a non-god, but without the blessing of a god, these non-gods cannot use the power the Elder Magi have imbued. In this case, this does not mean they have given up the rights to their power, but it could be considered "stolen" power.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        The Elder Magi have the power to create, and destroy worlds, as well as what's inside the world itself. They are the beings who have created numerous races of beings to this day, who are in possession of the different attributes that exist throughout the different worlds of the universe.

        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The essence used to do this is ichor, which can only be controlled by trained practitioners. This the main essence used by the Elder Magi to create familiars.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          These are beings that are created for those known as avatars, the ones who travel Animus Regnum in pursuit of adventure and timeless experiences. Familiars are seen with every avatar and are a way to know if one has been chosen by the Elders as an avatar.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The ichor is gold in color, sweet, smelling like honey, and yet an essence that flows through the entire universe. Ichor is some form of energy that can control the cosmos itself.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Ichor is used to infuse the familiars with life and give the familiars power over the elements of earth, wind, fire, and water. It is a rare and powerful substance.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Main 2 -->
<div class="main" id="main2">

        <p>
          The familiar will sometimes consume it for nourishment when they are in need and can unlock greater powers. Ichor is also vital to all life in the Cosmos.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        The creators of the familiars, on the other hand, are on a higher plane of understanding and are capable of using their own ichor to manipulate and create aspects of the world. However, a being may only imbue their powers to one familiar at a time. Ichor is not what keeps the familiar alive; that is, their soul.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          There are many types of familiars such as Ey3s and Anim3. Familiars are unique beings that thrive when they are connected to a chosen avatar.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Again, one cannot be an avatar without a familiar; otherwise you are considered a traveler, and that comes with restrictions. This is why those who seek adventure in the Animus Regnum universe look to be chosen by a familiar so they can travel to areas restricted to those who aren't avatars.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Before the advent of avatars, the Elder Magi were themselves the only active individuals in Animus Regnum. Then, the arrival of the first avatar fostered the creation of the many races that exist throughout all the worlds of the Animus. However, much like familiars, these avatars can be given ichor by the Elder Magi, but their consciousness must be awakened to make use of it.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          An artifact created by the Elder Magi using ichor and another essence known as Ayah, was the Apertus Sphera. This is a sphere of energy created with a Merkabic core, molded by diamondine.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- right -->

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          A liquid form of diamond used to create legendary time crystals that are imbued with the essence of Ayah and ichor. The inside of the sphere has a chromatic cosmic cloud that is a result of the two essences being combined with each other and being placed inside a bubble of diamondine.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        The diamondine Merkabah in the center creates the energy for the crystal to become suspended in time. It is said those who approach an Apertus are separated from reality and time for a moment until they touch the sphere and claim it.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This has caused multiple people to move through time in ways undescribed and also takes them sometimes to completely random locations, so those who find these legendary orbs, think twice before dealing with them.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          It is said that a skilled practitioner of the craft can make themselves appear at any location or time using the energy of the Apertus Sphera. When one isn't ready for the journey or doesn't have the knowledge, they are sent to any number of places in the universe at the whim of the Apertus.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Apertus Sphera are also known to be used to access treasures created by the Elder Magi themselves, granting them great power and knowledge. They are like keys to unlocking the secrets of the Elder Magi, who whispered their wisdom into the mind of the world.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          They are like doorways into the pure joys of existence, where one can enter into a place that is far purer than any heaven conceived by most beings. They are like eyes to see the truth of reality; to see beyond this world and beyond death. The Apertus Sphera reveal the secrets of ones beginnings, their purpose, and their long-lost future.

        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          The Apertus Sphera are extremely rare. The Elder Magi are responsible for creating the artifact, but the Elders themselves are neutral, and would not want to be affiliated with it because it could be used for evil. The artifact can be used for good or evil, but the Elder Magi know that the beast who uses it for "evil" is not evil, but rather, is possessed by the desire for power.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        The spirit that possesses the artifact is the only one who can control it. This has led to the demise of many worlds, resulting in the Elder Magi not being willing to give up an Apertus, for it could be used to save and create as well.

        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          However, in the imagination of the Elder Magi, it is said that when a familiar and avatar are together along with their Apertus, this trio will be able to open the "COSMIC GATES".

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          It is said that this power comes from the "Divine Sphere" which exists in the spiritual world. The Divine Sphere is said to remain in an eternal cycle of regeneration where all actions are removed from natural laws.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          It is said to have infinite power, being a limitless pool of energy, and also is hailed as the "Fountain of Youth". There have been many who have tried, but very few have reached the GATES; and it's been known that all who have attempted have been destroyed by the power they sought. During their final moments, many of these Magicians are reported to have heard heavenly music coming from the Gates.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Only one person has ever entered the COSMIC GATES, and that is the Elder Magi Efficio, who is rumored to be their creator.

        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- right -->

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          A young mage practicing under the guidance of the Elder, once overheard him talking to one of the Gods about the GATES, saying inside was not only unique treasures, but a sanctuary for souls to retreat to should they want to escape the noise of the universe around them.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        An oasis of luxury where those inside enter a small world in a separate dimension with rare resources and minerals that are unique to the COSMIC GATE.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Still, this is all just a rumor, as Elder Efficio denies this and says he's just as curious about the GATES as anyone else, studying them to build his knowledge of the craft.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Another type of artifact created by the Elder Magi are spheres that are known as the Oculi. These are spheres that are found in the deepest voids of space, made out of  refined metal that cannot be forged by man.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The Oculi are made with materials that are indestructible, each one being made of a different metal. They are very hard to locate as the voids they are found in are said to be points of space where not even the light of stars can reach.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          These Oculi are said to have the ability of containing the presence of the Elder Magi at different locations of Animus Regnum. If summoned by a truly skilled practitioner of the art of the craft, these Elders will appear before the summoner, granting them the power of the Elder Magi in the process.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The creation of the Apertus or Oculi is not possible for any other than the Elder Magi, or in other words, the founders of the universe.

          To create their own Apertus would require great power. The Elder Magi are beyond even the gods themselves in terms of power. So the only way to create their own Apertus is to come close to the Elder Magi themselves.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        This is where the hierarchy of Elder Magi comes into play. The Elder Magi are above the gods, as their creators, and there exists a god above all other gods.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This god resides in the heavenly realm of the old gods and has power close the Elder Magi. This being is known as YHWH, which can be translated to "I am that I am". The name is often pronounced Yahweh, but it's a being of pure consciousness and energy.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          this entity is the one used by the Elder Magi to create their artifacts. But this is strictly a rumor, as the Elder Magi themselves wish to keep YHWH a secret, and therefore do not mention it's true name or existence.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The Elder Magi and YHWH are mentioned and described in many religious text across the cosmos, but the natural natural laws that govern the universe prevent these sacred texts from referring to their true names. Ultimately, the oldest and most well-known artifacts of the Elder Magi are the Apertus Sphera.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Each Elder Magi has their own individual artifact that creates a portal to YHWH. The name of this artifact is unknown and is a special artifact that they keep a close eye on, and a few have been known to hide these artifacts in places that are hard to find.

        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- right -->

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          These artifacts are known to be made of ichor and Ayah, and they are said to be able to form a portal to the realm of YHWH. These artifacts are never mentioned by name in any text, not even the most ancient of scrolls. So it's currently unknown how many of these there are.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        These artifacts are thought to be hidden in the most sacred of places, or in very unlikely places. Any attempt to unveil these artifacts will be met with the highest level of protection. If one were to find this artifact, it is said they would need to find the Elder Magi, who are the sole protectors of this artifact.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          If one were to ever be able to wield the artifact, they would be granted unbelievable powers that would far exceed all other deities. However, the Elder Magi can use this artifact to destroy the universe itself and restore it, just to protect their power.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          So this artifact is said to be very dangerous. The artifact can be wielded by anyone, even though it's name is not known to anyone in the universe.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The Elder Magi are said to have a large number of artifacts that they themselves created, as well as several other sacred relics from other initiates of their order. However, even though the Elder Magi are known as the founders of the universe, one source of their power comes from the realm of YHWH.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          It is even possible that YHWH is their true creator. Only the Elder Magi knows the true answer, but they will not speak of this to anyone.

          It is a theory that the knowledge of the Elder Magi comes from the realm of YHWH, and all their teachings are the result of the knowledge they gained from YHWH. The Elder Magi are said to have created the entire universe, and to be able to create almost anything they wish.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        With this power, they are said to be able to channel the energy of YHWH. With this channeled energy, they can channel it to their relic, which then creates a portal to the realm of YHWH. The Elder Magi are not allowed to keep these portals open for long, as they could affect the stability of the entire universe.

        </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The Elder Magi are beings that exist in an infinite number of dimensions. All of the dimensions they exist in are connected in one way or another.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          They are in multiple dimensions at once, in all of which they are always present in one form or another, even if they are in different bodies, seeing as how they are the creators of the universe. They are said to be able to summon their bodies to them, no matter where they are, or which dimension.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Some say the Elder Magi spend their time in the heavenly realm, called Elysium, where they watch over the fate of the universe and all its inhabitants. A person who possesses an Apertus, Elysium, which is a realm of pure energy, can be reached both astrally and physically.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          Elysium is a place without time, where the souls of the dead will return to, but an artifact can be used to enter Elysium prematurely.

        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- right -->

      <div class="right">
        <p>
          The souls of the dead can return to the material realm, but only with the assistance of a spirit with a body that calls you to return. The spirit that grants you this, is the one who will occupy your body while you are in Elysium, seeing as how it's not your body.


        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        Elysium also has a physical realm that is a interconnected with it where beings can travel and visit beings that trained by the MAGI. There are also rumors that some of the Elder Magi train scholars from all over the cosmos. They are taught the ways of the Craft, and are trained in the ways of the Elder Magi.


      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This is the road of the ones that wish to follow the Elder Magi, of which there are many.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          It's also possible to enter the physical realm of Elysium without the assistance of a master of the Craft. It's possible for beings to cross over without the assistance of a spirit. They only need to be experienced in astral projection to enter this realm alone, and this is one of the basic things taught by the MAGI.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          There are some scholars that claim to be able to channel the energy of YHWH and form portals to this realm on their own, and it's known that this is a dangerous feat for those not trained by the Elder Magi or MAGI.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          If one were to channel the energy of YHWH without the assistance of a master, entire planets  would be destroyed and reformed, and this is why the Elder Magi keep such a tight watch on it.

          There are many other ways to enter paradise besides the path of the Elder Magi. The paradise known as Elysium can also be reached through gnosis, which is the same as self-observation. Another means of reaching Elysium is the Path of the Old Gods, which is a series of rituals performed by shamans and practitioners who followed the very first gods ever created by the Elder Magi.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        The physical realm of Elysium is a true utopian paradise where crime is non-existent and the threat from war is never a thought.

      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          One would think there aren't shops in a place like this but, this is a physical realm where MAGI create artifacts for experiences and trades these goods for the primary cosmic currency known as "undavis", which means the "Flow of Energy".

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          This word is created from the Latin words unda, meaning water, wave and/or flow, and the word vis, meaning energy, force and/or power.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          The markets in Elysium are said to contain the most advanced goods in the galaxy and offer them at prices that can only be found here. Workers are paid in undavis, which is the most valuable currency in the cosmos. Even though people don't need to work to survive, people work here instead for their dreams and help build the visions of others.

          Real estate in the Elysium system is also the most desired in the galaxy and it's something that can necessarily be purchased. You need to go through multiple forms of clearance and be approved by the Elder Magi and the MAGI directly.

        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        The cost of  real estate isn't what makes getting space in this system hard. It's the requirements and status in society you must maintain, meaning you can't be a criminal and must also have reached a certain point of experience to reach this place at all.


      </p >
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          There are many places here that are built to look like Earth, but are in fact other worlds all their own. There are also places that are an exact replica of Earth, but are in fact virtual experiences and can save space. This is done so that people can go home whenever they wish.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
          There are also places that are an exact replica of any world, whether it's one in our universe, or one in another. These are created by the use of holograms that are powered by an inexhaustible energy source, which is one of the ways the MAGI are able to create anything that usually requires a long time to create in a much shorter time.
